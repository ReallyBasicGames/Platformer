## Getting Started
Building this project from source code took less time than writing this explanation! It just takes three simple steps:

### 1. Download Dependencies
This application requires [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for building projects and package management. Install these tools using their official installation guides.

Ensure that these programs work correctly by running the following commands in your terminal, command prompt, or PowerShell window:
```sh
node -v
npm -v
```
The output of each command should be the version of each tool. Check your installation if you get errors from these functions.

### 2. Download Packages with `npm`
Navigate to the [platformer/my-electron-app](platformer/my-electron-app) subfolder and run the following command to install all dependencies:
```sh
npm update
```

### 3. Run the Project
Run `npm start` in the [platformer/my-electron-app](platformer/my-electron-app) subfolder to start the application. A new window containing the game should appear.

## How it Works
We are using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), a package based on Chromium, which converts HTML pages into desktop applications.
